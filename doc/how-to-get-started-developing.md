# How to get started developing

Since this is a Javascript project, the package.json contains the commands to run things such as building, linting and the various types of test.

To get started working on the code itself you can take the following steps.

1. clone the project
2. cd into the project folder
3. npm install
4. npm run test ./test to confirm things are working
5. npm run test:watch ./test to continue running tests as you make changes inside the project
